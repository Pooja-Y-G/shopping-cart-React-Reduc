# shopping-cart-React-Redux

Build with add and remove button to the cart, Router is used to route from Home to Cart page switching and Redux store for managing the cart state while dispatching to an action when needed.

If item not added to the Cart there will be no remove button as item won't be available in the cart to remove the same and the logic applied to evry item in the shop.
